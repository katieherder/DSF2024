**Introduction**
“For too long a false conflict has been created between those who advocate randomised trials in all situations and those who believe observational data provide sufficient evidence. Neither position is helpful. There is no such thing as a perfect method; each method has its strengths and weaknesses. The two approaches should be seen as complementary.” -Nick Black, Why we need observational studies to evaluate the effectiveness of healthcare1
While Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold-standard of causal inference, real-world data is increasingly becoming used to support pharmaceutical research. The limitations of observational studies are well documented, but there are several limitations to RCTs as well, including difficulty assessing rare and long-term outcomes, ethical objects to randomization, political and legal obstacles, and restrictive eligibility criteria. While theoretically these obstacles could be overcome, doing so would come with astronomical costs1. Additionally, problems like placebo effect and lack of real-world context cannot be resolved in a RCT. Thus, using observational methods to complement RCTs is a practical and economical solution to evaluate what RCTs cannot and better interpret results from these trials. 

**Project Overview and Objectives**
The primary issue with observational data is due to a lack of randomization: internal validation may be jeopardized by unforeseen confounding factors non-uniformly distributed among intervention groups.1 While the reasons for using  real-world data to complement RCT findings have been described, biases inherent to observational study designs must be addressed, including selection bias, information bias, and confounding.
