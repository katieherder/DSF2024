In 2005, the NACC launched the Uniform Data Set (UDS) to develop clinical, imaging,  genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of AD among subjects in the NIA\u2019s Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRC) program. During annual UDS  visits for each participant, clinicians complete 16 data-collection forms encompassing various subjects, including participant demographics, neurological examination findings, and  diagnosis. Participants include AD patients, mild cognitive impairment subjects, and elderly controls. </p> <p>Data Collection:</p> <p>This data has already been collected.</p> <p>Data Storage and Backup:</p> <p>All data is stored securely in UA Box Health.

Neither position is helpful. There is no such thing as a perfect method; each method has its strengths and weaknesses. The two approaches should be seen as complementary.\u201d -Nick Black, Why we need observational studies to evaluate the effectiveness of healthcare1 While Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold-standard of causal inference, real-world data is increasingly becoming used to support pharmaceutical research. The limitations of observational studies are well documented, but there are several limitations to RCTs as well, including difficulty assessing rare and long-term outcomes, ethical objects to randomization, political and legal obstacles, and restrictive eligibility criteria. While theoretically these obstacles could be overcome, doing so would come with astronomical costs1. Additionally, problems like placebo effect and lack of real-world context cannot be resolved in a RCT. Thus, using observational methods to complement RCTs is a practical and economical solution to evaluate what RCTs cannot and better interpret results from these trials. </p> <p>Project Overview and Objectives The primary issue with observational data is due to a lack of randomization: internal validation may be jeopardized by unforeseen confounding factors non-uniformly distributed among intervention groups.1 While the reasons for using  real-world data to complement RCT findings have been described, biases inherent to observational study designs must be addressed, including selection bias, information bias, and confounding.</p> <p>Team Overview and Organization Structure I am working on this independent study project under the leadership of Dr. Bonnie LaFleur.</p> <p>Operations TBD</p> <p>Communications TBD</p> <p>Procedures TBD</p> <p>Community Practices TBD</p> <p>Open Science Commitment</p> <p>Code of Conduct</p> <p>Attribution, Authorship, and Ownership</p>"}]}
